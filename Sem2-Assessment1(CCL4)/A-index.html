        <h2>CasaNika</h2>
        <p>It all started from a girl who shared a short moment of baking carrot cakes with her mom. From that moment, I knew that I would love to make sweet treats for my loved ones. 
            The moment when my passion was put on hold, the more I yearn to mould it; and when I got the time to continue baking, the feeling of finally being able to pick up what you love doing started a fire in me. <br>
            <br>
        I began little by little. From giving it as a snack, to gifts and then when I got the first order I felt overjoyed. Then a couple of orders, until I saw an opportunity to open a booth for our Uni Event. At first I was hesitant, 
        but my friends and family believed in me and pushed me to grab the opportunity. In the short 2 days of preparation we nailed it! <br>
